### How to reframe a problem:

**Look outside the frame:**
What are we missing?

**Rethink the goal**
Is there a better objective to pursue?

**Examine the bright spots**
Where is the problem not?

**Look in the mirror**
What is my/our role in creating thia problem?

**Take their perspective**
What is their problem?

### Don't just focus on end customers (at first)

- Clay Christensen says that I novation comes from studying people who aren't your customers
- When we focus too hard on customers we alienate the non customers and that opens the space for competitors to swoop in
- Sequence for problem reframing options:
	1. Rethink the goals & Examine the bright spots
	2. Look outside the frame - who are other stakeholders?
	3. Take their perspective last
