**Backable** sounds very blockbuster-ish on Amazon - like a lot of marketing effort has gone into pushing it. Dan Pink has reviewed it too and that makes me curious enough to want to read it.

I've got a book called **Trusted Advisor** in my reading list. It's about how to generate trustworthiness - exude a sense of comfort and security - be that person who clients feel they can truly rely on. I think Backable might be a little of that mixed with **Persuasion**. I had skimmed through another on similar lines called - **Charisma** which spoke about how to attract the right kind of attention.

**What might be interesting**
1. Tips on how startups and SMEs can pitch effectively to investors
2. Tips on how his ideas or aggregation of ideas can be adapted to one's personal life 
3. What needs to be in place for backability to begin 
4. While he might be sharing tips and strategies for becoming backable, I'm curious about changing a person's mindset in a way that she can adopt these strategies - a lot of **how to ** books forget to address the mindset issue
5. Also... what role does culture - organisational or national - play in this context
