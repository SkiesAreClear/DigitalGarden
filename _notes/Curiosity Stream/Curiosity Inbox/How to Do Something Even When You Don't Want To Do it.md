<H3>Key Concepts</H3>
1. We seek out the **Expected Emotional Outcome** to gauge if we want to do something - it feels like a rational decision, but it is not. The *Analytical* brain is like a junior officer -  can only suggest, not implement
2. We need to replace a negative expected outcome with an activity that provides a positive feeling. To do this, we should try multiple activities to see what clicks - sticking to one thing might lead to failure
3. Learning or Unlearning requires - a measure of control, real time progress, quick wins. It cannot become only about the quick wins though - that becomes too reliant on the wrong incentives 
4. For us to change the way we do something - we need to feel good about what we replace it with - feeling bad is not enough
5. Addiction leads to stress - we believe we need *something* to survive and when it is not available, we fear the opposite of not being able to survive. We need to break this association with points 3 & 4.
