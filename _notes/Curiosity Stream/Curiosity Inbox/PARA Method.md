Interesting process to organize digital information 

**Project** is a "series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline."
**Area** of responsibility is “a sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time.”
**Resource** is “a topic or theme of ongoing interest.”
**Archives** include “inactive items from the other three categories.”

 A project without a corresponding goal is known as a “hobby.” If you’re not committed to or haven’t fully articulated the outcome you want, you must be doing it just for fun.

And if you have a goal without a corresponding project, that’s called a “dream.” You may desire it with all your heart and soul, but without an active project, you are not in fact currently making any progress.
