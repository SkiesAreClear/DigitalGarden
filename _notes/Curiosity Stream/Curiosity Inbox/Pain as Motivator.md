Inspiration is a short term temporary motivator - inspiration fades.

**Pain** is the key motivator. The fear of being left behind or having to do something one is not interested in, or retribution or rebuke. This motivates people to do more over the long term.

**How does this apply to me?**
1. Learning more and doing more to ensure I don't have to go back to a company
2. Trying out meditation and other calming stuff to keep myself sane and not affect relationships
3. Learning more to stay ahead of the game 
4. Figuring out my finances for long term security

**Key Question**
How does one find the right pain point to press?

**Applies to**
