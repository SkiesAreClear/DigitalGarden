#### Expert Name & Role
Ashok Jhansari, Leading expert on memory, face recognition and dementia. He's a cognitive psychologist and a Professor @ Goldsmith. Lives in Brighton. 

#### Summary
We spoke about our roles. Ashok spoke about his work in memory. Inwas curious about Encoding Specificity Principle. His expertise was more in brain conditions, early dementia etc. He shared some interesting stories. Expressed an interest in entering the corporate consulting space. I promised to send him scenarios.  

#### Key Ideas
- Pre frontal lobe controls personality, decision making and emotions - any damage to that can cause a permanent change of behavior 
- Story of a patient in his 40s... CFO of a Fortune 500 company. Had a stroke and Pre frontal lobe got damaged. He recovered to become a completely different person. Very charming and bright but unable to make simple decisions - spent 5 hours figuring out which restaurant to go to. Got divorced twice. Lost his job. Needs constant care but appears normal.

#### Aha Moments
- A person who takes drugs at 15 and quits at 20 is more affected than someone who takes drugs at 25 and quits at 30 - pre-frontal lobe is still developing till 25
- American Footballers suffer from brain lesions not because of a hard injury but many small injuries - they are at a high risk of getting Alzheimer's and dementia in their 40s, like the captain of a team who couldn't remember his biggest victory just 8 years ago
- Scotland has made headshot a foul for the above reason 
- I learned about the **#Encoding Specificity Principle** from his videos. basically the context you learn in playa a huge a role in memory. If you study something in one place you are more likely to remember it better in that place than elsewhere. Also works for mental states, which is why folks in Depression only remember negative memories and that's a chain that needs to be broken
- It's important not just to learn something, but learn it in context to what matters to you and apply it 
- Learning is best done in small, continuous chunks

#### Food for Thought
Article on [[Organisational Learning Scenarios]] where his expertise might be useful

#### Next Steps
- I've sent him the scenarios. and will put them up as an article for this week
- Should tag Gowri and Mohinish Sinha
