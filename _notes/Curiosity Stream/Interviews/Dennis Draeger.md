#### Expert Name & Role
- Dennis Draeger: Head of Research at Shaping Tomorrow
- Creates GIST Reports 
- Company uses AI to collect signalsl and develop forecasts

#### Key Ideas
1. **Strategic Foresight** as an area of interest
2. How **#[[Complexity Theory & Butterfly Effect]]**are linked - I need to start reading about this stuff first
3. Horizon Scanning is the same as Signals - ditch digging 
4. **#[[STEEP Theory]]**]]: Social, Technological, Environmental, Economic & Political filters to be used while looking at Signals + minimise assumptions 
5. **[[Backcasting Method]]** is the process of looking at a potential future event and imagining what needs to be done to make it happen - transformation roadmap
6. Big companies will pay for this because it is expensive, but they suffer from groupthink and risk-averseniss. Small companies really need it, but they are strapped for time and resources to do any strategic forecasting - How do we package this?
7. His meat manufacturer client diversifying into bio fuel
8. Discussion on how big consulting firms don't have the aptitude for this because of low risk appetite 

#### Aha Moments
1. Look for Weak Signals that can lead to Big Change 
2. The Past is as uncertain as the future. Both are based on human interpretation. 
3. Interesting to see how this will connect to Design Thinking - road mapping maybe?
4. #PROCESS: STEEP - BACKCASTING - DESIGN THINKING

#### Food for Thought
1. Find a way to automate signal collection
2. What frameworks can I immediately incorporate into a Roadmap Workshop?

#### Next Steps
1. Read Future Savvy, Signal & Noise, Future Ready for process
2. Write Linkedin Post to summarize the chat & thank Dennis for his time
3. Read up on complexity theory + butterfly effect & STEEP
