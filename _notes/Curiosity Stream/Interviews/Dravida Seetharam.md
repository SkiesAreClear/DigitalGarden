#### Expert Name & Role
Dravida Seetharam. Retired from IBM 10 years ago

#### Summary
Very interesting chat about life and art.

#### Key Ideas
1. Dravida told me about how he learned golf by simply walking up to a retired admiral at the golf course
2. How his pal from Dell rrquested him to show around Michael Dell's folks in Bangalore to avoid publicity 
3. How he took his pal to LK Advani's house to meet his daughter - got into trouble because IBM was servicing Congress that time
4. Showed me his art... not bad and how he is learning how to write


#### Aha Moments
1. The idea of internal journey and external journey. Ext journey is full of ups and downs and can only be sustained by a parallel internal journey that is made up of family, friends and curiosity - basically ways to strengthen your spirit
2. Dravida asked about how he can bring emotion into his writing... I spoke about applying principles of poetry. In the simplest, tighest way express what's most important. Maybe all writers should also write poems.

#### Food for Thought
Thinking about this whole internal journey piece. How can it be used to address mental health issues in times of Covid? Is there an idea here?

#### Next Steps
Keep channel of communication open with Dravida to shoot the breeze about life and art. I think he's an insightful old gent and these chats will help us both.
