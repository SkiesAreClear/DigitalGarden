Data shapes our decisions. It's objective and indisputable. Data is truth, but that truth is only as effective as our interpretation of it. We have a symbiotic relationship with technology and data. As human ingenuity leads to the emergence of new technology, it in turn shapes how we live, act and interact with each other, and our organizations. As we strive to make tech more human, it chips away a little at our own humanity - and that's where the tension lies. 

We will explore Rishad's views on balancing the "Spreadsheet" - the use of tech, with the "Story" - our humanness. We will speak about how organizations and leaders can integrate digital practices without over-optimizing their employees - leaving room for creativity and self actualization. We will speak about how the pandemic has created the illusion of proximity and what it means for meaning and motivation. It'll be an eclectic conversation for sure, as we rediscover what it means to be human in the age of AI.
