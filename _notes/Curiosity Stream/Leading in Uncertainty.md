**How to turn doubt into opportunity?**
1. Discovery: Why is being uncertain so uncomfortable
	- [[SCARF Model]]: If any of these are missing we feel uncertain and overwhelmed
2. Reflection: Breaking down the uncertainty problem into manageable bits
	- When we feel threatened we want to remove ourselves from the situation
	- What is the brain telling us?
	- What is factual and what is our perception? 
3. Action: Turning uncertainity into catalyst for success with leadership skills
	- You can't control the environment but you can control your thoughts
	- What action can I do differently?

Where there is change there is uncertainty.
