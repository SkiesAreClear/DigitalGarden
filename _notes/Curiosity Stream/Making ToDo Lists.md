- Having a lot of things to do makes us jittery, perhaps because we donâ€™t want to forget to do it. 
- When waiters took orders they remembered everything, but forgot soon after the customer had left
- When we write down a POA we feel less jittery, the act of putting it on paper frees the negative energy
- People who makes lists are less likely to procrastinate
- People who makes todo lists also **sleep 9 minutes faster** than others 
- The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
