### Introduction

- Relationship between structure and behavior holds central insight to systems thinking. External forces may act on a system, but it's the system's inherent structure that causes it to behave in a particular way. That's why while the external environment stimulus might be the same, different systems will react differently to them - Oil prices, competitive advantage, immunity, addiction, crime rate, recessions and inflations etc. 
- We are conditioned to assume the cause of problems being "out there" rather than "in here". But no one really creates those problems purposely. They persist because they are internal "systems" problems - Hunger, poverty, climate change, economic instability, war, famine etc. These are undesirable behaviours stemming from unfavorable characteristics of the systems themselves. If we want to change the outcome, we need to have the courage and wisdom to restructure the system. 
- Systems happen all at once. They are connected not just in one direction, but in many directions simultaneously. 
- Systems way of thinking is complementary to the reductionist way of thinking 
- Systems Thinking allows us to -
	- Hone our abilities to understand parts
	- See interconnections 
	- ask *what if* questions and imagine future possibilities
	- be creative in how we redesign systems 
- Behavior of a system cannot be known just by knowing the elements it is made up of 

### The Basics
- A system is an *interconnected* set of *elements* that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something 
- Elements of a system can be intangible too - school pride etc.
- What's more critical are interconnections
- **How to identify a system**: 
	- Can you identify separate parts? and
	- Do the parts affect each other? and 
	- Do the parts together produce an effect that is different from the effect of each part on its own? and 
	- Does this behavior over a period of time persist in a variety of circumstances? 
- **Runaway Loops** compound change in the direction of change - exponential ups in the direction of up and catastrophic downs in the direction of down
- **Balancing Loops** counter change in one direction with change in the opposite direction - if sonething goes up, something else goes down 
- Thinking in Systems gets us to stop looking for who to blame and ask instead - What's the system?" We realize that a system has the ability to cause its own behavior
